# image-resizing-program
A content-aware image resizing program in C that uses seam carving to intelligently remove low-importance pixel paths and preserve key visual features. Implemented with a modular structure using custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs), pointer-based matrix manipulation, and a command-line interface, alongside comprehensive unit tests for both data structures and image processing functions.
