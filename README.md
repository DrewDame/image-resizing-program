# image-resizing-program
This project involved developing a C-based, content-aware image resizing program using seam carving, featuring modular design with custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs), pointer manipulation, and optimized matrix operations. The implementation included a command-line interface and comprehensive unit testing for both data structures and image processing algorithms.
